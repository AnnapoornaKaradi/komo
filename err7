  on aks_komodor.tf line 41, in resource "helm_release" "komodor_agent":
  41:     file("${path.module}/komodor/values-komodor.yaml")
    |----------------
    | path.module is "."

Invalid value for "path" parameter: no file exists at
komodor/values-komodor.yaml; this function works only with files that are
distributed as part of the configuration source code, so if this file will be
created by a resource in this configuration you must instead obtain this
result from an attribute of that resource.
